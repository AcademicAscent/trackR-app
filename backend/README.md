# Antventure Backend API üêú

Welcome to the backend for the Antventure project API (aka trackR-app/backend), a robust API designed to manage user, goal, session, and progress data. This project uses a modern JavaScript stack with **Express.js**, **Prisma ORM**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Supabase** for a scalable and reliable foundation.

This API was developed as a collaborative effort btwn Elijah Reed contributing to the models +  routes for Sessions and Achievements table and bugfixing, and Niko Lewis handling all other aspects of the the APIs planning and build--with a focus on clean code, proper API design, and team-based development practices using AI-assisted workflows. Also special thanks to Jose for coming up with the adorable "Antventure" pun nickname for the app/ mascot. And thanks to both Jose and Wren for all the mentorships and support.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

-   **Node.js & Express.js**: The core runtime and web framework for building the RESTful API.
-   **Prisma ORM**: A next-generation ORM for Node.js and TypeScript, used to interact with the database in a type-safe and efficient manner.
-   **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source relational database used for data storage.
-   **CORS**: A Node.js middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
-   **Dotenv**: A module to load environment variables from a `.env` file.
-   **Supabase**: Utilized for a managed PostgreSQL database and authentication services.

## üó∫Ô∏è API Endpoints

The API provides a set of RESTful endpoints to manage the application's data. All endpoints are prefixed with `/api`.

### Achievement and Progress Endpoints üéØ

-   `POST /api/progress`: Logs a new progress entry for a goal.
-   `GET /api/achievements/:userId`: Fetches all achievements for a specific user.

### Goal Endpoints üéØ

-   `GET /api/goals`: Retrieves all goals.
-   `GET /api/goals/:id`: Retrieves a single goal by its ID.
-   `POST /api/goals`: Creates a new goal.
-   `PUT /api/goals/:id`: Updates an existing goal by its ID.
-   `DELETE /api/goals/:id`: Deletes a goal by its ID.


### Session Endpoints ‚è±Ô∏è

-   `GET /api/sessions`: Retrieves all study sessions.
-   `GET /api/sessions/:id`: Retrieves a single session by its ID.
-   `POST /api/sessions`: Creates a new study session.
-   `PUT /api/sessions/:id`: Updates an existing session.
-   `DELETE /api/sessions/:id`: Deletes a session.

### User Endpoints üë§

-   `GET /api/users`: Retrieves all users.
-   `GET /api/users/:id`: Retrieves a single user by their ID.
-   `POST /api/users`: Creates a new user.
-   `PUT /api/users/:id`: Updates an existing user.
-   `DELETE /api/users/:id`: Deletes a user.

### Authentication Endpoints (Supabase) üîë

-   `POST /auth/signup`: Registers a new user with Supabase Auth.
-   `POST /auth/login`: Authenticates a user and returns a session token.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

-   **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
-   **PostgreSQL Database**: You need a PostgreSQL database to connect to. The current setup uses Supabase, so you'll need to create a free project there.
-   **Supabase Account**: Sign up for a free Supabase account to get your database and API keys.

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url]
    cd trackR-app/backend
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Supabase connection strings and keys.
    ```ini
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://[user]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[database]"
    DIRECT_URL="postgresql://[user]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[database]"
    SUPABASE_URL="https://[project-ref].supabase.co"
    SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="[your-anon-key]"
    SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="[your-service-role-key]"
    ```
    You can find these values in your Supabase project settings under "Database" and "API".

4.  **Initialize Prisma:**
    Once your `.env` file is configured, generate the Prisma client to match your database schema.
    ```bash
    npx prisma generate
    npx prisma migrate dev --name init
    ```
    This will generate the `PrismaClient` and apply the migrations to your database.

5.  **Run the Server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The server will start on port `8080`. You should see `Server running on http://localhost:8080` in your console.

## üõ°Ô∏è Singleton Pattern & Cleanup Functions

To prevent common "prepared statement already exists" errors and connection pool issues in development environments, the project implements a **singleton pattern** for the Prisma client. This ensures that only one instance of the Prisma client is created and reused across the application.

The file `src/lib/prisma.js` contains this logic:

-   A global variable `globalForPrisma` is used to store the single Prisma client instance.
-   On subsequent imports, the existing instance is returned instead of creating a new one.

To handle graceful shutdowns and prevent lingering database connections, the code also includes cleanup functions:

-   `process.on('SIGINT', ...)`: This handles **abrupt terminations** (e.g., `Ctrl+C`). It disconnects the Prisma client before the process exits.
-   `process.on('beforeExit', ...)`: This serves as a safety net for **graceful exits**, ensuring the client disconnects when the Node.js event loop is empty.

These measures are crucial for maintaining a healthy connection to the database, especially during development when the server is frequently restarted.

## üí° Lessons Learned & Takeaways

### The Power of Teamwork and AI

This project was a fantastic learning experience, showcasing the benefits of a collaborative, AI-assisted development workflow. Key takeaways include:

-   **AI-Powered Project Management**: We used AI to help create a project plan, branching strategies, and detailed GitHub issues formatted in raw markdown. This streamlined our workflow and kept the team aligned on tasks and priorities.
-   **GitHub Projects Board**: Monitoring team progress with a GitHub Projects board provided a clear, visual overview of what was in progress, completed, and pending.
-   **Effective Team Roles**: **Elijah's** work on the **Progress** and **Achievements** models and routes seamlessly integrated with the core API. **Niko's** contribution, including the initial ER graphs and the detailed explanation of table relationships, and building out the core of the API provided a solid foundation for the entire project. 

### Technical Challenges & Solutions

-   **Prisma Connection Errors**: We encountered numerous  "prepared statement already exists" errors during development. Implementing the **Prisma singleton pattern** with cleanup functions was the key to solving this recurring issue.
-   **Database Relationships**: Creating the ER diagram and meticulously defining the relationships in `schema.prisma` was essential for ensuring data integrity and a well-structured database.
