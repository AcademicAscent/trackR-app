# Academic Ascent

# About
For our project, we were tasked with using an AI to help us develop our goal tracking application. Through this, we decide to create a web application called Academic Ascent!

Academic Ascent is a gamified goal-tracking web application designed for students and life-long learners. It's built to motivate users to stay on track with their studies and personal development goals by rewarding them with a unique achievement system.
